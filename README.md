# codeup-pre-work
* This is my git repo for my codeup pre-work, it will contain all my activities leading up to the begining of the class and will be updated regularly.

## Objective for this repo and the class
My plan is to attend codeup and become a full time software developer, i'm going to be working very hard and future git repos will exist to showcase further growth.

## Skills to grow upon and learn new skills
I have some JavaScript, CSS, and HTML skills from attending the UC Davis bootcamp, but I realize I have much more to learn, i'm very eager to learn new skills and a new language(Java) in the coming months, I hope anyone reading this is willing and able to assist.
